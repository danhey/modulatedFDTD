# modulatedFDTD
Implementation of finite difference time domain in Matlab demonstrating temporal modulations of permittivity.

This repo provides a barebones example of a temporally modulated permittivity in a waveguide after Fang et al. (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.153901) . This code was used in the production of my honours thesis. I've made it available for use as custom written FDTD featuring modulations is hard to come by.
